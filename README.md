# [Click Challenge](https://cyanic76.github.io/click-challenge/)

A new click challenge, but open-source.

This was a result as a joke between me and some other people.

## Goal of the challenge

Try to click as many times as possible **under 10 seconds**. *Or, fork it and edit the time limit.*

You can also play this with your friends to see who got the best clicking speed.

### Autoclickers

You may want to know what's the limit of your Autoclicker or just want to cheat, feel free to test it on my website.
